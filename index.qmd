# Data Preparation and Understanding

## Steps

1. Import Data
2. Describe Data
3. Clean Data
4. Explore Data
5. Wrangle Data

## Workflow

## Import Data

### How?

- Create an independent cleaning script located in `src/clean/` for each data source. Each cleaning script should import from each data source (directory or database) and write to `data/clean/`

### Why?

- A script that can run end-to-end is important for building an automated data pipeline for deployment
- An independent cleaning scipt for each data source is important for script maintenance and reuse
